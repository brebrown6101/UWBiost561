# Q0: Survey

<mark>**Intent**: This question is simply for course logistics and for the course instructor to get to know you.</mark>

- <u>**Question 0A**</u>: Please let me know your preferred name and preferred pronouns.

Bre, she/her/hers

- <u>**Question 0B**</u>: Please read the syllabus in its entirety and write, "I have read 
and understood the entire syllabus,"
for this question. If you have any questions about the syllabus (for example, on 
the homework submission policy or collaboration policy), you may ask them here.

I have read and understood the entire syllabus

- <u>**Question 0C**</u>: If any, please briefly describe the courses you have taken at UW that 
involve coding (in any language) so far and how familiar/comfortable you are in coding in R. (Note: I do not expect you to have 
taken any such courses already.)

I have taken BIOST 514 and 515 and I have also taken an R coding course during my undergraduate studies. I am pretty comfortable with R but there is still a ton I don't know.

- <u>**Question 0D**</u>: What do you hope to learn from this course? (It is alright if you leave this blank, but it would be helpful to hear your thoughts.)

I am excited to learn how to write code that others can use.


# Q2: Simulating the Central Limit Theorem

<mark>**Intent**: This question is a simple coding exercise to demonstrate
familiarity with how to do basic coding in R.</mark>

Load in the `generate_data` function using the following code (all one line).

```{r}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/generate_data.R")
```

This code sources the `generate_data` function into your current R workspace.

<u>**Question 2A**</u>: 
Read the function (either at the URL provided or by typing `generate_data` into your console), 
and in one to three sentences, describe the input and output of the provided
function and what the function is doing. You may use equations if needed.

The function produces a vector that is either equal to 1, 2, or 3. If the vector that is produced is equal to 1 it creates a normal distribution, if the vector is equal to 2 it produces a gamma distribution and if the vector is equal to 3 it produces a chi square distribution. It then prints whatever distribution its associated with and repeats this process n times. 

<u>**Question 2B**</u>: 
We will now be using the `generate_data` function.
Observe that if we run the following code, we would compute a (random, empirical) mean of the
a dataset with `n=10` samples:
```{r}
set.seed(1)
mean(generate_data(n=10))
```
Repeat the above code 10,000 times (i.e., 10,000 trials, but keeping `n=10` for
each trial), and plot a histogram of the 10,000 different empirical means with 100 breaks (i.e., `breaks = 100`).
Repeat this process for `n` with values of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 100, and plot these six histograms
in order of increasing `n`. 

Figure \@ref(fig:clt) shows the desired plot you aim to reproduce. 
In particular, reproduce the X- and Y-labels,
the title of the plot, and the plot layout. 
(Hint: You might find the `par` function useful, especially
the `mar` and `mfrow` arguments, as well as the `paste`
function. See the documentation for `par`.)

```{r clt, out.width = "600px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The figure you are trying to reproduce (without the Sample watermark) in Question 2B, barring the dimensions/proportions of the figure itself and randomness inherent to the simulation.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/clt_editted.png")
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)



num = c(1,2,3,5,10, 100)
  par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
for(x in num) {
 empmeans <- replicate(
  10000, mean(generate_data(n=x))
          )
  hist(empmeans, main = paste("Sample Size of", x), breaks = 100, xlab = "Mean")

}


```


<u>**Question 2C**</u>: 
In one to three sentences, write how the plot you reproduced helps to verify 
the Central Limit Theorem.

The plot shows that as you take larger sample sizes, the sampling distribution of the mean tends closer and closer towards a normal distribution. 

# Q3: Basic data analysis

<mark>**Intent**: This question is a simple data analysis to demonstrate
familiarity with how to perform basic operations in R.</mark>

In this question, we'll load a simple dataset related to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research.
The data originates from a single-cell database from 
[this study](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/seattle-alzheimers-disease).
However, since this is the first homework, we'll mainly work with donor-level
data instead of the cell-level data.

```{r}
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/sea-ad.csv")

head(df)

summary(df)
```

Here are brief descriptions of each variable:

- `Donor.ID`: The anonymized ID of the donor who donated their brain to AD research
- `Age.at.Death`: The age of the donor when they passed away
- `Sex`: The biological sex of the donor. (Kevin's comment: In this study, it seems like this is strictly only `Male` or `Female`...?)
- `APOE4.Status`: `Y` (for yes) or `N` (for no) if the donor has a particular genetic variant that is known to be a risk factor for AD
- `Cognitive.Status`: Whether the donor has dementia or not based on a wide array of cognitive assessments before death
- `Last.CASI.Score`: The last score the donor had, measured via CASI (a specific set of cognitive questions), before death
- `Braak`: Different severities of neuropathology based on the donor's brain tissue, extracted after the donor's consent and death 

Hopefully, this is a reminder to carefully describe your study variables in any dataset you publish or collaborate on!

<u>**Question 3A**</u>: Describe, in two to four sentences, what the `head(df)`
and `summary(df)` results display. 

The 'head(df)' results display the first six rows of data in the dataframe. The summary(df) results display the number of inputs for each variable and the quartiles, mean, median, and number of NAs for numerical variables. If the variable is a character variable, it just displays the classification.

<u>**Question 3B**</u>: Use a simple function to print out the dimensionality
of `df` (i.e., how many rows and columns there are). 
What is the class of `df`?

```{r}
dim(df)
class(df)

```

<u>**Question 3C**</u>: You'll note that in `summary(df)`, the variable `Age.at.Death`
is a `character`, even though it should be a numeric. This is because
there are values of `90+`. As a simple diagnostic, 1) replace all the `90+` values
in `df$Age.at.Death` with `90`, 2) convert `df$Age.at.Death` from a character
to a numeric, and 3) plot a histogram of `df$Age.at.Death`.

```{r}
df$Age.at.Death[df$Age.at.Death == "90+"] = 90
df$Age.at.Death <- as.numeric(df$Age.at.Death)
hist(df$Age.at.Death, xlab = "Donor Age", main = "Histogram of Donor Age")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:hist) shows the desired plot you aim to reproduce.

```{r hist, out.width = "300px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The figure you are trying to reproduce (without the Sample watermark) in Question 3C, barring the dimensions/proportions of the figure itself.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/histogram-editted.png")
```

<u>**Question 3D**</u>: The `summary()` function is much more useful when the columns
of `df` are factors, not characters. Write some lines of code to convert the variables
`Sex`, `APOE4.Status`, `Cognitive.Status`, and `Braak` to be factors. (This should take
less than 10 lines of code.)

```{r}
df$Sex <- as.factor(df$Sex)
df$APOE4.Status <- as.factor(df$APOE4.Status)
df$Cognitive.Status <- as.factor(df$Cognitive.Status)
df$Braak <- as.factor(df$Braak)
```
<u>**Question 3E**</u>: With this new version of `df`, after finishing the previous
questions, show the result of `summary(df)`.

```{r}
summary(df)
```
Figure \@ref(fig:summary) shows the desired output you aim to reproduce.

```{r summary, out.width = "400px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The intended output of Question 3E.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/summary-editted.png")
```

In one sentence, describe how the summary here (in Question 3E) is more
informative than the summary shown at the start of Question 3.

This summary provides us with how many values are in each category for categorical variables like Braak, Cognitive Status, Sex, and APOE4 Status. Changing age to a numerical value allows us to see the quartiles and the mean and median.

<u>**Question 3F**</u>: Using the `table()` function, display the relation
between `Braak` and `Cognitive.Status`. Please look at `?table` (for the documentation
of `table()`) if you are unfamiliar with this function.

```{r}
table(df$Braak, df$Cognitive.Status)

```

<u>**Question 3G**</u>: This question will be slightly challenging. The `table()`
function is not as useful when there are many unique values (such as in `Last.CASI.Score`).
To overcome this, look up the documentation for the `cut` and `quantile` functions.
The goal is to use the `table()`, `cut()`, and `quantile()` to
show the relation of the quantiles of `Last.CASI.Score` with `Cognitive.Status`.
You will want to use `na.rm=TRUE` when using the `quantile()` function.

```{r}
quantile(df$Last.CASI.Score, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.25), na.rm = TRUE)

Cut.Last.CASI.Score <- cut(df$Last.CASI.Score, breaks = c(66, 80, 89, 95,99), labels = c("(66-80]", "(80-89]", "(89-95]", "(95-99]"), include.lowest = TRUE)

table(Cut.Last.CASI.Score, df$Cognitive.Status)

```

Figure \@ref(fig:table) shows the desired output you aim to reproduce.

```{r table, out.width = "200px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The intended output of Question 3G.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/table-editted.png")
```

In one to two sentences, describe what you can learn from the relation between
`Last.CASI.Score` and `Cognitive.Status` based on this result.

You can begin to infer if there is an association between having dementia or not having dementia and CASI Score. From the table, it seems that participants that don't have dementia tend to score higher on the CASI test than those that do have dementia.
